# Timeseries-project-with-car-sales-data


step 1:
To plot a graph we need to go to insert graph then selet line with markers graph the go to select data tab the click on add tab and add your series name(sales) the add your series values then click on ok. click on edit tab then add axis label range then finally click in ok.
step 2:
In this e need to find the moving average, since this is yearly based data so we will be calculating 4 quaters.
note: select the first four sales and find the average of it and apply to the others. see to that for only 4 quarters wqe are calculating when going for average.

step3:
we need to calculate the centered moving average to smoothen the data so that it doesn't fall either side. we will find this centred average by calculating the average of first two values of the Moving average and drag and drop. we need to update data on the graph so go to select data and add Cma

step4:
we will calculate seasonality and irregularity by dividing the the sales and the Centered moving average.this we are doing inorder to find the actual values of seasonity and the irregularity out of sales. once we find thenm we will be able to prdict the trend by subtracting from the St,It.
